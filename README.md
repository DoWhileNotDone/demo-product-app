## About

This demo app will allow a user to upload a list of products, which will be processed into entities via a queue. The user will then be able to view a paginated list of products, and use searches to filter the product list.

These aspects were selected to experiment with [Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail), [Queue](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/queues), and [Scout](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/scout).

### Limitations

It is not full featured. 

While it uses Laravel 8 and Vue, it does not use Livewire/Tall. 

The test coverage is low. 

The models are not fully normalised, and there are no unique constraints. 

There isn't much in the way of validation, or job failure handling. 

The queue does not use batches, but sends the file path to a queue, which in turn delegates to a further queue for the item creation.

There is no flag to check that all items have been imported and indexed.

Pagination will scroll of screen if there are too many pages.

Handling of the search could be improved.

There is no list sorting.

## Installation

All instructions should be run from the root directory.

### Local Installation with Docker ###
